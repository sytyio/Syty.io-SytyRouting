# Syty.io-SytyRouting

This is an in-progress release of our routing tools prepared for RBC / 2022-RDIDS-2a (Innoviris funding, collaboration ULB/Synapsis)

Here we've been exploring various routing algorithms, to try and understand : 
- what is complex in routing
- how to route effectively
- how to contract a network
- how to work with multimodal data.

Ultimately, these tests have resulted in the article "Distances and shortest paths on graphs of bounded highway dimension: simple, fast, dynamic", published at the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA24).
